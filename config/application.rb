# ===============================================================================

# Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

#   1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
#      is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
#      in config/environments/development.rb:

#        config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }

#      In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

#   2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
#      For example:

#        root to: "home#index"

#   3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
#      For example:

#        <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
#        <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

#   4. If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

#        config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

#      On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
#      or load models when precompiling your assets.

#   5. You can copy Devise views (for customization) to your app by running:

#        rails g devise:views
